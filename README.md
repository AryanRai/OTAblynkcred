# RGBeatz
This is the Arduino code for RGBeatz 
RGBeatz is an open source project for controlling addressable RGB strips using a NODEMCU which is connected to the internet over wifi
It uses google firebase realtime database to communicate between the app and the MCU
It also has a real cool music reactive feature which is where the Beatz part of RGBeatz comes in
It reacts to music from your currently playing track on Spotify using the Spotify audio analytics api(no microphones involved)
Supports 5 RGB patterns more on the way (20 more)
Ota update support is on its way
